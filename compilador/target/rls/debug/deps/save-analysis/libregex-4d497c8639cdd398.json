crate provides a library for parsing, compiling, and executing regular\nexpressions. Its syntax is similar to Perl-style regular expressions, but lacks\na few features like look around and backreferences. In exchange, all searches\nexecute in linear time with respect to the size of the regular expression and\nsearch text.","sig":null,"attributes":[{"value":"deny(missing_docs)","span":{"file_name":[67,58,92,85,115,101,114,115,92,75,101,118,105,110,92,46,99,97,114,103,111,92,114,101,103,105,115,116,114,121,92,115,114,99,92,103,105,116,104,117,98,46,99,111,109,45,49,101,99,99,54,50,57,57,100,98,57,101,99,56,50,51,92,114,101,103,101,120,45,49,46,48,46,53,92,115,114,99,92,108,105,98,46,114,115],"byte_start":18182,"byte_end":18204,"line_start":520,"line_end":520,"column_start":1,"column_end":23}}]},{"kind":"Mod","id":{"krate":0,"index":56},"span":{"file_name":[67,58,92,85,115,101,114,115,92,75,101,118,105,110,92,46,99,97,114,103,111,92,114,101,103,105,115,116,114,121,92,115,114,99,92,103,105,116,104,117,98,46,99,111,109,45,49,101,99,99,54,50,57,57,100,98,57,101,99,56,50,51,92,114,101,103,101,120,45,49,46,48,46,53,92,115,114,99,92,108,105,98,46,114,115],"byte_start":22516,"byte_end":22521,"line_start":642,"line_end":642,"column_start":9,"column_end":14},"name":"bytes","qualname":"::bytes","value":"C:\\Users\\Kevin\\.cargo\\registry\\src\\github.com-1ecc6299db9ec823\\regex-1.0.5\\src\\lib.rs","parent":null,"children":[{"krate":0,"index":58},{"krate":0,"index":60},{"krate":0,"index":62},{"krate":0,"index":64}],"decl_id":null,"docs":"Match regular expressions on arbitrary bytes.","sig":null,"attributes":[{"value":"cfg(feature = \"use_std\")","span":{"file_name":[67,58,92,85,115,101,114,115,92,75,101,118,105,110,92,46,99,97,114,103,111,92,114,101,103,105,115,116,114,121,92,115,114,99,92,103,105,116,104,117,98,46,99,111,109,45,49,101,99,99,54,50,57,57,100,98,57,101,99,56,50,51,92,114,101,103,101,120,45,49,46,48,46,53,92,115,114,99,92,108,105,98,46,114,115],"byte_start":22480,"byte_end":22507,"line_start":641,"line_end":641,"column_start":1,"column_end":28}}]},{"kind":"Struct","id":{"krate":0,"index":186},"span":{"file_name":[67,58,92,85,115,101,114,115,92,75,101,118,105,110,92,46,99,97,114,103,111,92,114,101,103,105,115,116,114,121,92,115,114,99,92,103,105,116,104,117,98,46,99,111,109,45,49,101,99,99,54,50,57,57,100,98,57,101,99,56,50,51,92,114,101,103,101,120,45,49,46,48,46,53,92,115,114,99,92,99,111,109,112,105,108,101,46,114,115],"byte_start":44277,"byte_end":44285,"line_start":37,"line_end":37,"column_start":12,"column_end":20},"name":"Compiler","qualname":"::compile::Compiler","value":"Compiler {  }","parent":null,"children":[{"krate":0,"index":35},{"krate":0,"index":37},{"krate":0,"index":39},{"krate":0,"index":41},{"krate":0,"index":43},{"krate":0,"index":45},{"krate":0,"index":47},{"krate":0,"index":49}],"decl_id":null,"docs":" A compiler translates a regular expression AST to a sequence of\n instructions.
